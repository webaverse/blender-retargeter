# Easy Retargeting Plugin for Blender

This repo isolates the retargeting module from [Rokoko's Blender Plugin](https://github.com/Rokoko/rokoko-studio-live-blender) with none of the other cruft or frills.

## Retargeting
In order to retarget an animation in Blender you will need to do the following:

- Select an armature with an animation as the source armature, select an armature that should receive the animation as the target armature and then press "Build Bone List"

- Check if the bones got filled in correctly and fix any incorrect or missing bones

- Select "Auto Scale" if the armatures differ in size or resize them manually
- In "Use Pose:" select the pose that should be used for retargeting
- Important: Make sure that both armature are in the same pose for correct retargeting
- Press "Retarget Animation"
- Done!
